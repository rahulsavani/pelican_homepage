Game solvers
============

.. Below you will find links to solvers for games. 
.. For two-player games, the first two link to solvers that work with exact arithmetic, which is important for finding exact Nash equilibria.

  (also see `this Computational Management Science paper <https://doi.org/10.1007/s10287-014-0206-x>`_,
  available as pdf on `arXiv <http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.3969>`_)

* `Web-based Bimatrix Game Solver <http://banach.lse.ac.uk>`_  
  (also see `this Economic Theory paper <https://doi.org/10.1007/s00199-009-0449-x>`_, 
  available as pdf `here <http://cgi.csc.liv.ac.uk/~rahul/papers/avisetal.pdf>`_)

* https://github.com/rahulsavani/bimatrix_solver uses an identical back-end to
  the web-based solvers above, but can be installed locally and used offline on
  whatever size games you want.

* https://github.com/rahulsavani/zerosum_matrix_game_solver solves matrix games 
  via the pylibcdd exact arithmetic LP solver

* `Gambit: Software Tools for Game Theory <http://www.gambit-project.org>`_

* https://github.com/bimatrix-games is a repository of bimatrix game
  generators and algorithms for finding approximate Nash equilibria
  (also see this `SEA paper <http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04980>`_)

* https://github.com/polymatrix-games is a repository of polymatrix game
  generators and algorithms for finding approximate Nash equilibria
  (also see this `AAMAS paper <http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.06865>`_)

* https://github.com/rahulsavani/bimatrix_examples is a repository with
  bimatrix game generators with their extreme equilibria, and code to 
  test the output of lrs-nash
  (http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~avis/C/lrslib/USERGUIDE.html#nash) against these
