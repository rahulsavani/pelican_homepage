I am a Professor in the Economics and Computation 
Research Group in the Computer Science Department at the University of 
Liverpool.
I joined the Department as a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in October 2009, 
became a Senior Lecturer (Associate Professor) in 2013, a Reader in
2015, and a Full Professor in 2017.

Previously I was an EPSRC Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Theoretical Computer
Science studying `algorithms for computing equilibria in games`_ at the
University of Warwick (2006-2009).

Before that I studied at the `London School of Economics
<http://www.lse.ac.uk>`_ (1997-2006):

* BSc Mathematics and Economics (2000)
* MSc Operational Research (2001)
* PhD Mathematics (2006) under the supervision of `Bernhard von Stengel <http://www.maths.lse.ac.uk/Personal/stengel>`_ (`my thesis <http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/128/>`_).

As well as algorithmic game theory, I am interested in automated trading. I
first got interested via the `Penn-Lehman automated trading comptition (PLAT)
<http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns/projects/plat.html>`_. With `Ben Veal
<https://www.linkedin.com/pub/ben-veal/95/918/749>`_, we won the May 2005
competition and came second in the December 2004 competition (see `here
<href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns/projects/newsandnotes04.html>`_).
Subsequently, I provided consultancy services on automated trading for
proprietary trading firms, such as `Marex Spectron
<http://www.marexspectron.com/>`_ and `Pyne Trading
<http://www.pynetrading.com/>`_, developing and implementing automated trading
strategies for futures markets. I have supervised a PhD student, `Keren Dong
<http://www.csc.liv.ac.uk/~dkr/>`_, jointly with `Arctic Lake
<http://www.arcticlake.co.uk/>`_, a provider of electronic trading solutions.
From the start of 2015 to the end of 2018,
I was a consultant for
`Stratagem Technologies <http://www.stratagem.co>`_, looking at automated
trading in sports betting markets.
