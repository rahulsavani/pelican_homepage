I am a Professor in the Economics and Computation 
Research Group in the Computer Science Department at the University of 
Liverpool.
I joined the Department as a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in October 2009, 
became a Senior Lecturer (Associate Professor) in 2013, a Reader in
2015, and a Full Professor in 2017.

Previously I was an EPSRC Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Theoretical Computer
Science studying `algorithms for computing equilibria in games`_ at the
University of Warwick (2006-2009).

Before that I studied at the `London School of Economics
<http://www.lse.ac.uk>`_ (1997-2006):

* BSc Mathematics and Economics (2000)
* MSc Operational Research (2001)
* PhD Mathematics (2006) under the supervision of `Bernhard von Stengel <http://www.maths.lse.ac.uk/Personal/stengel>`_ (`my thesis <http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/128/>`_).

As well as algorithmic game theory, I am interested in automated trading:

* I first got interested via the `Penn-Lehman automated trading comptition
  (PLAT) <http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns/projects/plat.html>`_. With `Ben
  Veal <https://www.linkedin.com/pub/ben-veal/95/918/749>`_, we won the May 2005
  competition and came second in the December 2004 competition (see `here
  <href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns/projects/newsandnotes04.html>`_).

* Subsequently, I provided consultancy services on automated trading for
  proprietary trading firms, such as `Marex Spectron
  <http://www.marexspectron.com/>`_ and Pyne Trading, developing and
  implementing automated trading strategies for futures markets. 

* I supervised a PhD student, `Keren Dong <http://www.csc.liv.ac.uk/~dkr/>`_,
  jointly with `Arctic Lake <http://www.arcticlake.co.uk/>`_, a provider of
  electronic trading solutions. Keren worked mainly on VWAP execution
  algorithms.

* From the start of 2015 to the end of 2018, I was a consultant for Stratagem
  Technologies (acquired by Blockchain.com), looking at automated trading in
  sports betting markets, and in particular the use of reinforcement learning
  for market making.

* I currently supervise two PhD students on automated trading. 
  `Tom Spooner <http://cgi.csc.liv.ac.uk/~tspooner/>`_ is working mainly on 
  reinforcement learning for trading; he is currently on leave in AI team at JP Morgan in 
  London. `Nestoras Chalkidis <http://cgi.csc.liv.ac.uk/~nestoras/>`_ is funded
  by the Centre for Doctoral Training in Risk and Uncertainy; he mainly works 
  on classification for financial time series.

* I actively develop and trade automated trading strategies in futures and forex
  markets.
