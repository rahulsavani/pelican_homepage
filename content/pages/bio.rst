I am a Senior Lecturer (Associate Professor) in the Economics and Computation 
Research Group in the Computer Science Department at the University of 
Liverpool (since December 2013).
I joined the Department as a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in October 2009.

Previously I was as an EPSRC Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Theoretical Computer Science studying
`algorithms for computing equilibria in games`_ at the University of Warwick (2006-2009).

Before that I studied at the `London School of Economics <http://www.lse.ac.uk>`_ (1997-2006):

* BSc Mathematics and Economics (2000)
* MSc Operational Research (2001)
* PhD Mathematics (2006)

under the supervision of `Bernhard von Stengel <http://www.maths.lse.ac.uk/Personal/stengel>`_
(`my thesis <http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/128/>`_).

As well as algorithmic game theory, I am interested in automated trading. I first got interested via the `Penn-Lehman automated trading comptition (PLAT) <http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns/projects/plat.html>`_. With `Ben Veal <https://www.linkedin.com/pub/ben-veal/95/918/749>`_, we won the May 2005 competition and came second in the December 2004 competition (see `here <href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns/projects/newsandnotes04.html>`_). Subsequently, I provided consultancy services on automated trading for proprietary trading firms, developing and implementing automated trading strategies for futures markets. I have supervised a PhD student, `Keren Dong <http://www.csc.liv.ac.uk/~dkr/>`_, jointly with `Arctic Lake <http://www.arcticlake.co.uk/>`_; Keren is now working for a fund in Shanghai. I am currently a consultant for `Stratagem Technologies`, looking at automated trading in sports betting markets.
