I am a Senior Lecturer in the Department of Computer Science at the 
University of Liverpool.  I work on problems at the interface of 
economics/finance and computer science. I have worked extensively on 
equilibrium computation for game-theoretic models of strategic interaction. 
I have also worked as a consultant on a variety of algorithmic trading projects. 

Previously I held a UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council 
(EPSRC) Postdoctoral Research Fellowship at the University of Warwick. Before 
that I got a PhD in Mathematics from the London School of Economics.
