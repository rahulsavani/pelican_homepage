POSTDOC APPLICATION DEADLINE 7TH APRIL 2024: 
============================================

Automated Analysis of Strategic Interactions
--------------------------------------------

- https://www.jobs.ac.uk/job/DGK292/research-associate-automated-analysis-of-strategic-interactions
- https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3847580265

Come work with me, `Ted Turocy <https://tturocy.github.io/>`_;, and `Yongzhao Wang <https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/yongzhao-wang/>`_ 
(and others) on problems at the intersection of Game Theory and Reinforcement Learning.

Working on our project - `Automated analysis of strategic interactions <https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/automated-analysis-strategic-interactions>`_ -
you will be both publishing cutting-edge research and helping to build the next generation of Gambit software tools (http://gambit-project.org) for modelling and analysing game-theoretic models.

You will be affiliated with, and based at, either the University of Liverpool or University of East Anglia, while being an employee of the Alan Turing Institute, the UK's National Data Science and AI Centre.

Any questions, feel free to message me.

Secondment to Alan Turing Institute (ATI)
-----------------------------------------

Since 2023-04-01 (until late 2025) I am seconded to the ATI to lead a
project "Automated Analysis of Strategic Interactions" with `Prof Ted Turocy <https://tturocy.github.io/>`_; 
more info: https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/automated-analysis-strategic-interactions.

For this project, I am still based in Liverpool, working with Ted, who is based
at UEA, and 
`Yongzhao Wang <https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/yongzhao-wang/>`_,
who is an ATI employee based in Liverpool.

**Research Interests:** Game Theory, Algorithms & Complexity, Machine Learning, Automated Trading, Agent-Based Modelling

I am a Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the 
University of Liverpool; I am also a Visiting Researcher at the
`Alan Turing Institute <https://www.turing.ac.uk/>`_. I work on problems at the interface of 
game theory/economics/finance and computer science. I have worked extensively on 
equilibrium computation for game-theoretic models of strategic interaction,
recently focusing also on multi-agent reinforcement learning.
I have also worked as a consultant on a variety of algorithmic trading projects.
