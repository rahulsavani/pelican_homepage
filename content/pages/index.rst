I am a Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the 
University of Liverpool.  I work on problems at the interface of 
game theory/economics/finance and computer science. I have worked extensively on 
equilibrium computation for game-theoretic models of strategic interaction,
recently focusing also on multi-agent reinforcement learning.
I have also worked as a consultant on a variety of algorithmic trading projects.
