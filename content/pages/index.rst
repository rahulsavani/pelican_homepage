I am a Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the 
University of Liverpool.  I work on problems at the interface of 
economics/finance and computer science. I have worked extensively on 
equilibrium computation for game-theoretic models of strategic interaction. 
I have also worked as a consultant on a variety of algorithmic trading projects. 
Currently, I lead the `Economics and Computation Research Group
